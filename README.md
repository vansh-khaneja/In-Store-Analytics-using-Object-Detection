# In-Store Analytics using Object Detection
This project implements Object Detection for performing In-Store Analytics using `yolov8n` as the per-trained model. This can help in getting using insights for the store manager to analyze and boost up yhe sales by monitoring the crowd at a particular instance in the store. To learn more about the project please refer this [article](link).

## Introduction

In this project, we used Matryoshka Representation Learning embeddings for efficient multi-query retrieval. The embeddings are generated using `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` models and stored in the Qdrant vector database. This approach allows for scalable and accurate retrieval of relevant information from large datasets.

## Features

- Fast and efficient way for data retrieval
- Supports `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` models
- Two stage retrieval for better searching
- Scalable and high-performance retrieval system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vansh-khaneja/Multi-Stage-Queries-with-MRL
    cd Multi-Stage-Queries-with-MRL
    ```

2. Set up the Python environment and install dependencies:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up Qdrant:

    Follow the [Qdrant documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) to install and configure Qdrant on your system.

## Execution
1.Create a .env file and create a variable ```OPENAI_API_KEY``` storing your API key.


2.Download the dataset for this project [here](https://run.unl.pt/bitstream/10362/135618/1/TEGI0570.pdf) or you can try with your own dataset. Just change the path of the PDF here.

```sh
    loaders = [
    PyPDFLoader("/content/TEGI0570.pdf"),
    ]
```


3.Execute the ```main.py``` file by running this command in terminal.

```sh
    python main.py
```
